<h2> 👋 Howdy, Nerds </h2>

- I am an eternal learner, forever curious and eager to embrace new knowledge. <br>
- I'm a total space nerd wondering about the mysteries of the universe.<br> It's like a never-ending adventure that I can't resist! 🖼 <br>
- I'm also a vegetarian and I have a passion for cooking up experimental dishes.🍔 <br>
- I'm all about pushing boundaries, whether it's with food or my own life. 🤷 <br>

My DNA is practically made of code because that's who I am - a <b> Backend Developer</b> 👨‍💻
and I love every bit of it!
By the way, I have a passion for sketching, stargazing, surfing internet & flaunting my cool yoga poses 💬
